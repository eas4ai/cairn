# Changelog

Every release is one tagged commit; the tag is v<version>, and
scripts/release.mjs cuts it, as docs/releasing.md describes. Versions
follow semantic versioning below 1.0: a patch changes no verdict,
record shape or document meaning; a minor adds or revises
requirements, verdicts or record shapes and still reads earlier
records; a major changes what earlier records mean.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-17

- `cairn decide --decided-by` takes `developer`, `agent` or `joint`,
  case-insensitively, and stores the value lowercase. Any other value is
  refused; name the person or tool in `--body` instead. `cairn reversals`
  counts one decider once and reports a value it does not recognize as
  `unrecognized: <value>` rather than dropping it (DEC-020).
- The wake names a decision record as a repair when its `Realized by`
  section holds `(none yet: recorded, not built)` above a commit that
  resolves: the record says it was never built directly over the commits
  that built it (DEC-021). A section holding the placeholder alone is
  unchanged, and a shallow clone still gets its own repair.
- Cairn installs in Muse from `.muse-plugin/plugin.json`, with one hook
  entry file per hook under `bin/hooks/`.

Upgrading a repository that already holds records: existing records are
never rewritten, and nothing is lost. Two things change on the first
wake. A record whose placeholder survived its realization is named as a
repair, one record per wake, until each placeholder line is removed. A
decider outside the three words is refused the next time a decision is
written, and until then it is reported as unrecognized rather than
counted as one of the three. The kernel changed, so every mechanism
re-runs once, as it does at any upgrade.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-15

- `cairn --version` prints the version from package.json.
- scripts/release.mjs cuts a release as one tagged commit, after
  checking the tree, the version, this file, the tag and the loop.
- This changelog, and docs/releasing.md.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-15

- Cairn installs as a plugin from a marketplace, in Claude Code and
  in Codex: the manifest, the marketplace listing and hooks/hooks.json
  register the session-start and stop hooks from the plugin.
- The second audit's remediation: the gates bind to the commitment,
  every record shape is read or repaired by name, the hooks find the
  kernel and the project, the lints and tests observe what they name,
  the documents say what the code does, and the verifiers' findings
  are closed.
- The kernel ceiling is 1600 lines.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-04

- The kernel, the four skills, and the hooks registered by hand.
