// 'snapshot' or 'log') and plan.terminal ({kind, target, payload}), and it unconditionally injects
// intent/results into the appended terminal record after running plan.writes and an optional fn.
// A 'file' write's bytes must be fully known before staging (before any write in the transaction
// executes), so a write whose content depends on another write's own result (e.g. a snapshot sha)
// cannot be expressed as a 'file' descriptor. Roadmap and ADR content that must reference such a
// result is therefore written directly to the working tree before the transaction starts (the same
// pattern lib/auth.mjs's authorize() already uses: it writes nothing itself and just detects which
// protected paths are already dirty), and the transaction's own 'branch' write commits whatever is
// then on disk for the given paths via `git commit --only`, which needs no bytes staged up front.
// This mirrors the spec's own crash-recovery text ("stages exact bytes ... before ... performs the
// ordered writes") for the writes that tx.mjs can express; the roadmap/ADR bytes are not part of
// its own pre/post identity tracking, an accepted, already-precedented limitation (authorize()'s
// 'branch' write has the same property).
// Fix round 1 finding 4 (Minor): this moved Current: for any slug that differed from the
// roadmap's own Current: line, not only a supersession successor's start -- a plain start()
// (never following a supersede()) silently retargeted Current: to whatever slug was asked for,
// even though the spec-phase-tail workflow (outside this plan) is what is supposed to have
// already written Current: to name that section before sudus start ever runs. Current: now moves

// builds and runs the successor-start transaction (finding 12: promote no longer duplicates this
// body). The roadmap's Current: edit is a {store:'file'} write like any other planned write --
// known before staging (setCurrent's own throw, e.g. "no Current: line", now happens before

// the mutation section 2 calls a breach ("A direct edit ... by another command is a breach").
// Correct: a kernel-managed path is allowed through only when it still validates; otherwise every

// reserved-path edit gets.

// Fix round 2 finding 4 (Minor): this module's own kernelManagedValid duplicated lib/scope.mjs's
// exported one, and had already drifted from it -- lib/scope.mjs's version (after plan 07's own
// fix round) checks the write against the local sudus-managed ledger (recordManagedWrite) or an
// exact match with the allowed base's bytes, not merely "does it still parse under its reader";
// a hand edit that happens to be schema-valid JSON is a breach even though it would have passed
// this module's own, looser check. Deleted; lib/scope.mjs's kernelManagedValid is imported and
// used directly, with `base.tree` (the decision's own base snapshot, already read below) as its
// baseTree argument -- the same role `tree` (the allowed-base snapshot) plays in
