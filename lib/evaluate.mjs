// route evaluator wholesale -- the old evaluate(), EVALUATOR_DEFAULTS, THRESHOLD_KEYS,
// validateEvaluatorSettings, applyEnvelope and calibrate() are gone with it, not carried forward
// or stubbed. Later tasks in this plan (4-10) add the floor, the state builder, the request
// builder, the parser, the veto/composite, measure() and calibrate() back in this plan's shape.
//
// This task (3) is the first slice: the policy constants (the five dimensions and their level
// 0-4 criteria text, copied verbatim from docs/spec/sudus-v2.md section 10's Score table and from
// .superpowers/bench/composite-design.md, which already ran this exact wording live at 0.895
// route accuracy -- .superpowers/bench/results.md), the construction version, the request/state
// size limits, the probability-sum tolerance, and the policy digest that covers all of them plus
// the settings fields section 10 says reset calibration.

// it never has (git log -- lib/escalate.mjs shows no rename), and the interfaces line calls
// escalate.mjs "unchanged" by this plan, so escalate.mjs is not edited to add that name. The

// became the first code in this file to call normalizeDraft(draft) and draftDigest(D) directly --
// reproduced as `ReferenceError: normalizeDraft is not defined` before this fix (see

// confidences, usage, model} or {invalid: reason}. No network call happens here, and nothing
// below throws past this function -- every defect in the body returns {invalid: reason} instead.
//
// The 0.02 probabilities-sum tolerance (POLICY.PROB_TOLERANCE, Task 3) exists because the

// three of 22 valid HTTP 200 responses (A03, A10, D06) to a 1e-6 sum check: their probabilities
// summed to 0.99 across the five levels, a rounding artifact, and the harness rejected them as

// 3 snippet) and rejected every real response on the first dimension checked. That check is
// removed entirely: the parser no longer requires or reads `a.type`. `legend` was already
// untouched by this function -- never read, never required -- and stays that way, optional and
// ignored, exactly as a real answer's own extra key. `score` is the probability-weighted mean
// level, a float (e.g. 3.44), not a rounded integer; `level()` already accepted any finite number

// requested boundary test pass): comparing `Math.abs(sum - 1)` directly against
// POLICY.PROB_TOLERANCE (0.02) wrongly rejects a mathematically exact sum of 0.98 or 1.02 --
// IEEE 754 double arithmetic computes `Math.abs(0.98 - 1)` as 0.020000000000000018, which is

// probabilities that sum to 0.98 are decomposed (verified: every decomposition tried lands on
// the same nearest-double 0.98 and the same 1.8e-17 excess). Without this epsilon the review's
// own instruction ("a sum of 0.98 ... valid") is unsatisfiable by construction, not by a bad

// near 1) while staying eight orders of magnitude below the 0.001 gap between the spec's valid

// to any of them resets calibration." / "Its denominator is labelled cases whose suggestion was
// agent; a false downgrade is one the developer labelled developer. The one-sided 95% exact
// binomial upper bound on the false-downgrade rate is a kernel constant, not a setting, fixed at
// 5%; the sample floor is min_calibration_agent_predictions (default 60) predicted-agent cases."
// Calibration is advisory tuning data (it never gates whether the agent may decide -- there is no
// route mode any more): calibrate() only records a 'calibration' record over what the log already
// holds; nothing it computes feeds back into measure()'s own floor/veto/composite/suggested path.

// upperBound: the unchanged one-sided exact (Clopper-Pearson-style) binomial upper confidence
// bound on the true error rate p, given `errors` failures in `n` trials at level `alpha`. Finds
// the smallest p such that P(X <= errors | n, p) <= alpha by bisection over the regularized
// binomial CDF (binomCdf below) -- pure, no I/O, no settings, so it is trivially testable against
// the brief's own known values (n=60/errors=0 clears 0.05; n=30/errors=0 does not; more errors
// only ever raises the bound).

//
// Fix round 1 (Critical C1, review of commit bd51dcbf): the first version keyed "missing" off
// whether *any* measurement existed anywhere in the open-commitment scope, and "digest" off
// whether none of those measurements matched this draft. That tracks "was anything measured in
// this commitment," not "was this draft measured" -- the instant one other draft in the same open
// commitment had already been measured, a brand-new, never-measured draft (including a
// review-source draft still pending, with no measurement record at all) fell into "digest"
// instead of "missing" (reviewer's reproduction: draft A measured, draft B -- never measured --
// checked, and got "digest" instead of "missing"). Rebuilt per draft instead: `myIntent` is the
// most recent `evaluation-intent` in scope whose own `draft_digest` equals `draftDigest(D)` --
// missing when no such intent exists at all, missing (with its own wording) when that intent
// exists but no measurement names it yet (a review source still pending, or a jev crash not yet
// recovered), and digest only once this draft's own intent+measurement genuinely exist but the
// single most-recent measurement in scope now belongs to a different draft (some other draft was
// measured more recently, shadowing this one) -- not merely "some measurement, for any draft,
// exists somewhere in scope."
//
// Fix round 1 (Important I1): scope now honors `range().closed` the way `rangeOpen` (lib/scope.mjs)
// and `openRange` (lib/escalate.mjs) already do elsewhere in this codebase (`Boolean(start) &&
// !closed`), rather than only testing `r.start` truthiness. `range()` finds the *last* `start`
// record scanning backward regardless of whether that commitment later closed, so once a
// commitment has closed and no new one has started, the old `r.start ? r.records : log` check
